All of them know each other, but during pandemic people usually works remotely and our guys are no exception from the rule. Hence some of them don't go to bureau - we will simulate it by disconnecting nodes in the 'work' layer. Moreover it's obvious that Internet has bigger impact in the field of information spreading than real interactions. By that reason in our model transitions for social network will be higher weighted than for work layer."
